Initial Tree:
        20
       /  \
     10    40
          /  \
        30    50


Now Inserting 15:
So 15 is lesser then 20 and Greater than 10,So it will go at the left of 20 but right of 10.
Like this:

         20
       /    \
     10       40
      \      /   \
       15   30     50

- Balance Factor is within -1 to 1, so Already an AVL TREE.
- Height=2
- No Rotation Needed as Already AVL TREE
